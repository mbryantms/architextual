## ✍️ 1. Start with a Strong Headline

Your headline is what makes people click. It should be:

- **Clear:** Readers should know what they’ll get
- **Specific:** Use numbers, facts, or keywords
- **Intriguing:** Create curiosity without clickbait

**Examples:**

## 📑 2. Hook with a Powerful Introduction

The first few lines need to **pull readers in**. Try:

- Asking a question
- Stating a surprising fact
- Telling a short story
- Highlighting a pain point
