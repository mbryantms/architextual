Understanding how artificial intelligence makes decisions has become increasingly crucial as these systems are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Machine learning interpretability seeks to demystify the decision-making processes of complex AI models.

## The Need for Interpretable AI

As AI systems become more complex and are deployed in critical applications like healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, the ability to understand and explain their decisions becomes paramount. Interpretability is not just a technical necessity but a societal requirement.

> The goal isn't just to build powerful models, but to create systems whose decisions can be understood, verified, and trusted by humans. This transparency is essential for responsible AI deployment.

## Modern Interpretability Techniques

Recent advances in interpretability research have produced various techniques for understanding model behavior, from simple feature importance measures to sophisticated attribution methods. These approaches help bridge the gap between complex AI systems and human understanding.
