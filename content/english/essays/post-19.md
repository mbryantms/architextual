##  Quote to Reflect On

{{< quote name="Jared" designation="CEO, MIRI/SIAI" >}}
‚ÄúWhile headlines often focus on conflict, they rarely capture the full humanity of Palestinians or the creativity and strength they display daily in cities like Ramallah and Gaza. Poetry plays a central role in cultural resistance ‚Äî Mahmoud Darwish‚Äôs verses serve as a voice for a people in exile.‚Äù

##  Final Thoughts

Palestine is not just a land in conflict. It is a land of poetry, olives, music, and memory. Its people are not just survivors ‚Äî they are **teachers, engineers, poets, and visionaries** holding on to their identity with grace and strength.

The Palestinian struggle is not just political ‚Äî it's deeply human.
