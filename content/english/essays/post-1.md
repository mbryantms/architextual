## 💬 Quote to Reflect On

{{< quote name="Jared" designation="CEO, MIRI/SIAI" >}}
“While headlines often focus on conflict, they rarely capture the full humanity of Palestinians or the creativity and strength they display daily in cities like Ramallah and Gaza. Poetry plays a central role in cultural resistance — Mahmoud Darwish’s verses serve as a voice for a people in exile.”
