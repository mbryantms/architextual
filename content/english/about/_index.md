## Professional

### Writing & Research Contributions

My contributions span multiple fields, particularly in the domains of artificial intelligence, finance, and digital culture. Through investigative journalism, deep-dive essays, and technical papers, I have sought to provide readers with nuanced insights and critical perspectives on evolving technologies.

### Consulting Experience

As a consultant, I have advised organizations on strategic research initiatives, content development, and emerging technological trends. My expertise has been particularly valuable in risk assessment, policy analysis, and educational content creation.

## Websites

### Social News & Discussion

I have participated in various online discussions and contributed insights across multiple platforms. My primary focus has been the exploration of emerging technologies, their ethical implications, and their potential impact on society. Although I am currently not accepting new commissions, I continue to engage with digital communities and share my thoughts through my website and selected online forums.

I have no association with any entities using the name "Gwern" in other contexts, including the French singer, locations in Wales, or accounts linked to attempted extortions on Pivory.com.

#### About This Website

My reading habits have evolved significantly over time. As a child, I would simply pick up where I left off at the school library, methodically working through books. However, as I started encountering more complex texts, I realized the necessity of tracking references and maintaining a structured reading list. 

Initially, I kept track of recommended books on paper, intending to finish them all within a few months. However, the list continued to expand beyond what I could feasibly read. It wasn’t until I trusted digital tools that I migrated my reading list to an online format. Now, I use platforms like Goodreads to monitor my reading history, trace the evolution of my interests, and maintain an archive of knowledge. Whether I will ever complete my list by 2070 remains an open question.
